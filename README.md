***

This **coursera-heterogeneous** project provides offline resources to work on the assignments of [**Heterogenous Parallel Programming**](https://www.coursera.org/course/hetero) course from [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/).
This is a collaborative effort by the students of the course and you are welcome to [contribute](#contributors) to improve it.

Files available include:

- WB API header file (`wb.h`)
- Official assignment files (`mp0.cu`, `mp1.cu`, ...)
- Official test datasets
- Programs to generate extra datasets to test assignments (`GenDataMP1.cpp`, `GenDataMP2.cpp`, ...)

All of this works **only** if you have access to CUDA hardware or an OpenCL installation.
